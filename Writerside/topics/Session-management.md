While not strictly necessary, the following things are highly recommended:

* Ensure that the user credentials are correctly validated before creating a session.
* Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms to capture and address any issues that may arise during the session creation process.

## Endpoint

`POST /session`

## Sequence and Flow

1. **Import Dependencies**:
    - The necessary modules and utilities are imported, including `express` and `createSession`.

2. **Router Initialization**:
    - An Express router is initialized using `express.Router()`.

3. **Define Route Handler**:
    - The route handler for `POST /session` is defined. This handler performs the following steps:

4. **Parse Request Body**:
    - The request body is parsed to extract the user's credentials (`username` and `password`).

5. **Validate User Credentials**:
    - The user's credentials are validated (implementation not shown).

6. **Create Session**:
    - The `createSession` function is called with the user's information to create a new session and generate access and refresh tokens.

7. **Set Headers**:
    - The `Authorization` and `Refresh` headers are set with the generated access and refresh tokens.

8. **Send Response**:
    - A JSON response is sent back to the client, indicating the success of the operation and including the `tableId`.

9. **Error Handling**:
    - Any errors that occur during the process are caught and passed to the next middleware for handling.

## Example Request

```http
POST /session
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "john_doe",
  "password": "password123"
}
